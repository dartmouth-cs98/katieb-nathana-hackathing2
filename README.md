# katieb-nathana-hackathing2
For Hack-a-thing-2, we attempted to create some intial UI designs for our project in Figma and a basic frontend interface using these designs. Nathan focused on creating the UI designs in Figma (https://www.figma.com/file/bH0wrjy2hawAUbFuAqpaSX/Home?node-id=0%3A1). Katie focused on creating a frontend starterpack using webpack, sass, babel, eslint, node, npm, and yarn, based off of the CS52 short assignment (http://cs52.me/assignments/sa/starterpack/). After that, we both worked on emulating Nathan's design by creating a frontend React webpage.

Through this hack-a-thing, Katie learned how to set up our frontend with the proper dependencies that will allow us to execute our code compactly. Nathan learned how to work with Figma and create reusable components, in order to make a beautiful UI design. We both refamiliarized ourselves with React and how to create a webpage.

This hack-a-thing relates to our project idea because we can use this UI design and basic frontend interface as the basis for our entire website. If our group agrees this is the direction we want to go in, we can just continue adding in the rest of the functionality we want to the webpage we have started here.
